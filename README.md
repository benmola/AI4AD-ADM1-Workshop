## Overview
This repository provides an interactive workshop for biogas researchers, AD plant operators, consultants, and sustainability professionals to explore anaerobic digestion (AD) modeling using the Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1). The core focus is on mechanistic simulation of biogas production and process stability through Python-based notebooks. No prior coding experience is requiredâ€”run simulations directly in Jupyter or Google Colab to test feedstock mixes, operating conditions, and visualize outcomes.

The primary notebook (**PyADM1-R4-Workshop.ipynb**) introduces a simplified ADM1 implementation for hands-on experimentation with digester dynamics. An additional interactive UI (**UI-Workshop.ipynb**) offers sliders for quick scenario testing as an extra feature.

## Purpose
- Simulate AD processes to predict methane yield, pH stability, and FOS/TAC ratios.
- Experiment with UK-based feedstocks like maize silage, grass silage, food waste, and cattle slurry.
- Understand how parameters (e.g., temperature, flow rate, reactor volume) impact biogas output and digester health.
- Ideal for educational workshops, research prototyping, or operational optimization in renewable energy.

## Key Features
- **ADM1 Simulator**: Core Python code in `ADM1.py` for running simulations.
- **Notebooks**:
  - **PyADM1-R4-Workshop.ipynb**: Main tutorial on ADM1 mechanics, influent setup, and result analysis.
  - **UI-Workshop.ipynb**: Optional interactive interface with sliders for feedstock ratios and parameters.
- **Outputs**: Interactive plots (via Plotly), summary plots for methane/biogas flows, pH, and stability metrics.
- **No Installation Needed**: Run in Google Colab or locally with Jupyter.

## Quick Start
